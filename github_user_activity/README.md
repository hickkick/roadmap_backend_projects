# GitHub User Activity CLI — Ruby Solution

Hello!

This is solution to the [GitHub User Activity CLI project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity), built with **Ruby**. It was fun to implement, and I hope you enjoy checking it out. I was supposed to write tests, but then I realized the GitHub API itself is the ultimate test - if it works there, it works everywhere! 🤷‍♂️

> ***Note:*** This program fetches real data from GitHub's API. Please be gentle with the requests - GitHub's rate limits are watching! 👀*

## How to run

**Option 1 - Interactive mode:**
```bash
ruby github-activity.rb
# Will prompt you to enter GitHub nickname
```

**Option 2 - With argument:**
```bash
ruby github-activity.rb <username>
# Direct nickname as command line argument
```

The program will show you someone's GitHub adventures in a nice, organized way! 😄
