# Number Guessing Game — Ruby Solution

Hello!

This is solution to the [Number Guessing Game project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game), built with **Ruby**. It was fun to implement, and I hope you enjoy checking it out. I was supposed to write tests, but honestly, who has time for tests when cosmic forces and luck are involved? 🤷‍♂️

> ***Note:*** This program relies on your intuition and perhaps a little bit of magic. Results may vary depending on your connection to the universe.*

## How it works

### Starting the game
```bash
ruby app.rb
# Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
# I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
```

From here, cosmic forces and good luck will guide you on your journey! ✨

Thank you for your attention 🙌
